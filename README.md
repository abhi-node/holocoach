## üéØ Overview

HoloCoach is a desktop application that automatically syncs your chess games, analyzes every move with Stockfish, and provides AI-generated insights to accelerate your improvement.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

HoloCoach implements a sophisticated analysis pipeline with move classification:

```
Game Sync ‚Üí PGN Parse ‚Üí Stockfish Analysis ‚Üí Move Classification ‚Üí AI Chat ‚Üí UI Update
```

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Game Retrieval**: Fetch games from Chess.com/Lichess APIs
2. **PGN Processing**: Parse game metadata and moves
3. **Engine Analysis**: Stockfish evaluates every position (depth 20+)
4. **Move Classification**: 4-tier system with centipawn loss calculation
5. **Accuracy Calculation**: Chess.com-style accuracy scoring
6. **AI Integration**: Context-aware chat responses via n8n/OpenAI

### Application Architecture
- **Main Process**: File system, database, native Stockfish, and external APIs
- **Renderer Process**: React UI with strict security isolation via contextBridge
- **Preload Scripts**: Secure IPC bridge between main and renderer processes
- **Docker Services**: Containerized AI services (n8n + OpenAI integration)

### Move Classification Algorithm
The system uses a sophisticated centipawn-loss based classification:
- Evaluates position before move, after move, and after best move
- Accounts for mate positions and sign changes
- Provides both discrete categories and continuous accuracy scores
